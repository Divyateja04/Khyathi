          	Hey Khyathi, So you already know that you are my closest friend in life. I never was close to anyone in life until now. To be honest, typing a message to you is really hard, I already told you most of the stuff. I can tell you one thing though, I had many experiences during this lockdown some good and the other bitter but you stood by me for every one of them and I hope I was able to do the same for you.

      <section class="section5">
        <div>
          <span>And you are the only one with whom I shared every moment of my life!!! Even the most weird and absurd ones!! I also still remember the times when you consoled me when I was depressed, crying or doing random nonsense. I honestly enjoyed every moment of life with you. Like I can't even imagine this lockdown without you or Yashaswi and most importantly Prime Video, Hotstar and Netflix(I never paid though).</span>

      <section class="section1">
        <div>
          <span>And that means I would have been sulking around throughout lockdown without you and this is true. You can be like - I have other friends but then I never spoke to anyone as much as I spoke to you. I guess, by the time I send this message to you, it'll be at 80k (Both WhatsApp and telegram combined). Youâ€™re almost like a celebrity in my eyes. And you know what, you deserve a prize for putting up with me, I know you don't accept it but then it's hard to put up with me.</span>

      <section class="section2">
        <div>
          <span>You asked me a lot of times why I care for you right? It's simple...Actually, wait, it isn't simple. I don't know why I care, But I know that I do care a lot, I worry a lot if something is wrong with my best friends,  which is mainly you!</span>

      <section class="section3">
        <div>
          <span>And you know what? I like doing stuff with you but then I'm scared idk why? and that's why I randomly irritate you. We relate on tooo many things that it's impossible to find such a perfect friend.</span>
